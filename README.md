## Synchronous VS Asynchronous Communication

**Synchronous**: The client waits for the server to respond before continuing with the execution of the program. The client is blocked and can't do anything else in the meantime.

**Asynchronous**: The client doesn't wait for the server to respond before continuing with the execution of the program. The client is not blocked and can do other things in the meantime.
