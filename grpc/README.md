# gRPC

RPC is a modern open source high performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework that can run in any environment. It can efficiently connect services in and across data centers with pluggable support for load balancing, tracing, health checking and authentication. It is also applicable in last mile of distributed computing to connect devices, mobile applications and browsers to backend services.

## Protocol Buffers

Protocol buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. Think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler ðŸ˜…

### Protocol Buffers vs JSON

- Protocol Buffers are smaller than JSON
- Protocol Buffers are faster than JSON
- Protocol Buffers require less CPU and bandwidth than JSON

## HTTP/2

- It sends multiple requests between client and server in a single TCP connection
- It is binary, instead of textual, therefore more compact
- It is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking
- It allows servers to "push" responses proactively into client caches instead of waiting for a new request for each resource
- Header compression is a default part of the protocol

### Different types of HTTP/2 communication

- Unary: classic request/response
- Server streaming: client sends a request and server responds with a stream of data
- Client streaming: client sends a stream of data and server responds with a single response
- Bidirectional streaming: both client and server send a stream of data
