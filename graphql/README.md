# GraphQL

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## gqlgen

[gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/) is a Go library for building GraphQL servers without any fuss.

- it is based on a Schema first approach — You get to Define your API using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language.
- it prioritizes Type safety — You should never see map[string]interface{} here.
- it enables Codegen — We generate the boring bits, so you can focus on building your app quickly.
